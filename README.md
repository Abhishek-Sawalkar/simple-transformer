# Simple Transformer

## Overview
The goal of this repository is to a version of the Transformer (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) model that is **easy to read**, **easy to modify / add to existing pipelines** and **modular**. 

I will be working on building a model that is also Keras compatible (only using the TensorFlow backend though).
