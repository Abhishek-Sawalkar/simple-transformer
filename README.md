# Simple Transformer

## Overview
The goal of this repository is to a version of the Transformer (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) model that is **easy to read**, **easy to modify / add to existing pipelines** and **modular**. 

I will also work on a script to compile a Keras compatible model for maximum ease of use (however, it will only work using the TensorFlow backend since I am using Tensorflow specific functions and not K.backend).
